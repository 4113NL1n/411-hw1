As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand the features that makes GiggleGit different so I can use GiggleGit to its full capacity.
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to make sure my team is adapted to the workflow and make use of GiggleGit.

Theme: Ease of use for both Developers and general Users
Epic: Documentation
As a Developer that has to use GiggleGit, I want to be able to understand GiggleGit quickly and seamlessly integrate it into my work. 
Task: Ease of usage  
Ticket 1 : Comprehensive guide 
    Create a manual that focus on installation, usage and commands. It's important for this to be quick start guide, not a full documentation of everything. 
Ticket 2 : Example project
    Have different project that show the unique traits of GiggleGit, how this version control differ from other version control system

As a user I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine 
This is not a user story because this is very vague and feels more of a requirement than advice. We do not know why they want authentication, and what kind of authentication.
